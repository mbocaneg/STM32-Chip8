# Description
This project includes firmware and PCB/Schematics for an emulated CHIP-8 system. It is based around the STM32F103 MCU, and uses a 16 button keypad and an SSD1306 OLED as I/O. It is capable of running retro video games such as Invaders, PONG, and Tetris.

# Project Directories
The directory `Firmware/` contains an STM32CubeMX project containing all necessary software, drivers, and firmware for the system.

The directory `Hardware` contains the schematics and PCB layout for a physical prototype of the system.
