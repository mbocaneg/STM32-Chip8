# STM32-Chip8
A CHIP-8 implementation that runs on the STM32f103 microcontroller.


# Description
This project uses the STM32f103 microcontroller to emulate the CHIP-8 virtual machine. It is capable of running retro video games, using a 16 button keypad and an SSD1306 OLED as I/O. It uses Free-RTOS to handle I/O and the CHIP-8 emulation cycle.
